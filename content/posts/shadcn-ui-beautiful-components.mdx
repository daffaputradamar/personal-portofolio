# shadcn/ui: Building Beautiful and Accessible UI Components

In this post, I'll share my experience using shadcn/ui in projects like BidikASN, Ecosystem BMW, and Finance Family. shadcn/ui has transformed how I approach UI development, offering a collection of beautifully designed, accessible components that can be easily customized to match any design system.

## What is shadcn/ui?

shadcn/ui is not a traditional component library but rather a collection of re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. It provides a set of accessible, customizable, and beautiful components that you can copy and paste into your projects.

## Key Features of shadcn/ui

### 1. Accessibility First

All components are built with accessibility in mind, following WAI-ARIA guidelines and best practices. This ensures that applications are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities.

### 2. Customization

Unlike traditional component libraries, shadcn/ui components are copied directly into your project, allowing for complete customization. You can modify the components to match your exact design requirements.

### 3. Performance

Since components are part of your codebase, there's no additional bundle size from a third-party library. This results in better performance and faster load times.

## Why I Choose shadcn/ui

### 1. Design Consistency

shadcn/ui provides a consistent design language across all components, making it easier to maintain a cohesive look and feel throughout the application.

### 2. Developer Experience

The ability to copy and modify components directly in your project gives you complete control over the implementation while maintaining the benefits of pre-built, tested components.

### 3. Integration with Tailwind CSS

As someone who loves Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui's use of Tailwind for styling makes it a perfect fit for my development workflow.

## Real-World Applications

In my projects:

- **BidikASN**: Used shadcn/ui for form components and modals

## Best Practices

1. **Component Customization**: Take advantage of the ability to customize components to match your design system
2. **Accessibility**: Maintain the accessibility features when customizing components
3. **Theme Consistency**: Use the provided theme system to maintain consistent styling
